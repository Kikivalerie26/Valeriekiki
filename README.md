DSL Investigations Management Project 	May 2023   
While engaging in the DSL Investigations Management Project, our team pioneered the eProb lifecycle, achieving notable efficiency and accuracy improvements. Through rigorous investigations and resolution strategies, we successfully tackled duplicate data issues, enhancing data integrity. This meticulous approach to data management led to a remarkable 40% increase in data accuracy. By fostering essential inter-departmental communication, we streamlined our processes and information flow. Furthermore, my initiative in developing and managing multiple JIRA dashboards significantly elevated our project management capabilities. These dashboards provided comprehensive data visibility, enabling effective and precise project tracking, thereby optimizing our overall project execution and monitoring strategies."
